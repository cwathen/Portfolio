#### PROFILE

I am an Analyst who has worked within Academia for the last four years. I am looking to pivot out of Academia into an industry role. I have six years of experience in data analysis, communication, problem solving, and have an analytical and curious mindset. I am fascinated about how numbers can tell us stories of the past, present, and future, as nearly everything has data. In addition, I have over four years of experience collaborating with cross-functional teams to understand complex systems and processes and can tailor any data interpretations to the needs of the recipient.
